Bazaar is a new app store for GNOME with a focus on discovering and
installing applications and add-ons from Flatpak remotes, particularly
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/). It emphasizes supporting the
developers who make the Linux desktop possible. Bazaar features a
"curated" tab that can be configured by distributors to allow for a
more locallized experience.

Bazaar is fast and highly multi-threaded, guaranteeing a smooth
experience in the user interface. You can queue as many downloads as 
you wish and run them while perusing Flathub's latest releases. 
This is due to the UI being completely decoupled from all backend operations.

It runs as a service, meaning state will be maintained even if you
close all windows, and implements the gnome-shell search provider dbus
interface. A krunner
[plugin](https://github.com/ublue-os/krunner-bazaar) is available for
use on the KDE Plasma desktop.

Thanks to [Jakub Steiner](http://jimmac.eu) for designing Bazaar's
icon.

### Installing

Pre-built binaries are distributed via Flathub and GitHub actions:
