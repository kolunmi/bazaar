These are the issues that need the most amount of attention and would be an effective way to get started:

- [Help Wanted issues](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22)

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue then feel free to post on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar/discussions)

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

* The original github issue you want to contribute to

## Development Environment Setup

### Building and installing Bazaar

These instructions cover building from source on a Bazzite system. Please feel free to contribute instructions for other systems:


```
git clone https://github.com/ublue-os/packages
```

```
cd packages
```

Click "Copy full SHA" [here](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar/commits/master/)

bump this line `staging/bazaar/bazaar.spec` at the top to the newest Git commit SHA

and replace the placeholder at the top of the file

```
# staging/bazaar/bazaar.spec
# renovate: datasource=git-refs depName=https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar.git versioning=loose currentValue=master
%global commit put_the_commit_hash_here
```

build the thing (might take a while)

as long as fedora doesn't have the blueprint-compiler version needed you'll have to add the ublue-os/staging copr as a build argument to the mock wrapper

```
just build ./staging/bazaar/bazaar.spec -a "https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/ublue-os/staging/fedora-$(rpm -E %fedora)-$(uname -m)/"
```


allow temporary changes to `/usr`
```
sudo bootc usroverlay
```

swap out system bazaar with latest bazaar
```
sudo dnf5 swap bazaar "mock/fedora-42-x86-64/result/*.rpm"
```

to undo the installation just reboot your system

#### Find out which version is installed for bug reports
```
rpm -qi bazaar
```
#### Verbose output
```
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all bazaar window --auto-service
```

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:

- [ ] Use the GNU Style Guide
- [ ] Format your commits using `clang-format`; see [.clang-format](/.clang-format)
- [ ] Follow the [GNOME Commit Style](https://handbook.gnome.org/development/commit-messages.html)
