## Find an Issue

[Help Wanted Issues]()

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue]([TODO](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can ‚ö†Ô∏è **explain how people can ask for an issue to work on**.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.
