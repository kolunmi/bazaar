#+title: Bazaar TODOs

These are roughly in order of descending priority:

* UI

1. Completely redo the Flathub Page to be more appealing
   - perhaps replicate flathub's design a bit
   - waiting on designs from people
2. Create new "Landmark" widget in rust for the transaction view
   - replicates a timeline of events
   - more clear than previous UI
